First do this on Home directory:

https://gist.github.com/slashsBin/a383559dc1f683c7cd502af9fd39c3ab


then validate project:

https://teacher.buet.ac.bd/ashikur/ns2/



Go to:

cd ~/Desktop

create a file named example.tcl

edit on that file: puts "Hello ns2"

then run this:

ns example.tcl




How to deal with ns2 ?
1.

First u have to create a Network topology. In that topology there would be some nodes with specific co-ordination on 2D or 3D.

to do this:

go to:  ~ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35/indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen/setdest 

then ./setdest command to see versions. 

./setdest -v 1 -n 5 -M 15 -t 20 -p 30 -x 600 -y 400 > scn

then 

2.

CBR= constant bit rate traffic jam : Actually design the connection who is the sender and who is receiver.

go there,

cd ~ns-allinone-2.31/ns-2.31/indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen

then command:

ns cbrgen.tcl -type cbr -nn 5 -seed 1 -mc 10 -rate .25 > cbr-exp1 

then edit cbr-exp1


copy these files scn,cbr-exp1 to Desktop 


3.

the Trace generation:

download a sample tcl file from  
https://teacher.buet.ac.bd/ashikur/ns2/
 

 last section , then edit this with avobe files.

 then copy that to Desktop

 run command line:

 ns downloadedTCLfile.tcl
